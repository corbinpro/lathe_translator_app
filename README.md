# lathe_translator_app
This CLI program is intended to be used with a hardinge T65 cnc turret lathe, and fusion. 
It is intended to handle the common problem of the turret hitting the sub spindle with drill/tap/boring bar holders, or anything mounted on the outside of the turret. 
The main focus of this program is to streamline that process and reduce the need for hand coding.
In addition it can "hand code" a basic tapping head cycle, as this machine is not capable of rigid tapping. 
After installation, add the filepath to the export folder to the .json file. include all slashes. 
Originally developed on macOS, will be adapted for windows.
